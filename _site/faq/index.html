<h2 id="what-is-qtz">What is QTZ?</h2>

<p>The Queer/Trans Zine Fest (QTZ) is a free 1-day zine fair held on unceded Narragansett land (Providence, RI) organized by and for queer, trans, and gender non-conforming people. Our definition of “zine” is deliberately broad and we invite all creative people with radical ideas to apply. In the past, our exhibitors have included poets, comic artists, community organizations, and activist collectives, as well as makers of ceramics, apparel, herbal medicines, and textiles.</p>

<h2 id="when-and-where-is-qtz-2023-taking-place">When and where is QTZ 2023 taking place?</h2>

<p>QTZ 2023 will take place outdoors at The Steel Yard on Saturday, September 2, 2023 from 11am–5pm. There will be additional programming throughout that weekend at the Binch Press / Queer.Archive.Work Studio.</p>

<h2 id="is-qtz-free">Is QTZ free?</h2>

<p>Yes! QTZ is free to attendees and exhibitors. There is no tabling fee and exhibitors will be offered a small stipend on a sliding scale.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-the-qtz-application-process-work">How does the QTZ application process work?</h2>

<p>Once applications close on Monday May 22nd, 2023 at 11:59pm, they will be reviewed by the QTZ fest organizers using a rubric that prioritizes Providence-based Black, Indigenous, people of color.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-event-wheelchair-accessible">Is this event wheelchair-accessible?</h2>

<p>Yes! The Steel Yard hosts a variety of events throughout the year, including Queer/Trans Zinefest. All Steel Yard events are 100% wheelchair accessible. Event attendees have access to both a fully ADA accessible portable restroom as well as custom wheelchair-accessible picnic tables.</p>

<p>The Steel Yard’s outdoor area is paved, with a combination of bricks and permeable concrete. It is mostly flat and even, with a slight slope in some areas. The main entry to the Fest location is connected to the sidewalk with a slight upward slope.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-have-a-way-for-attendeesexhibitors-to-cool-off">Do you have a way for attendees/exhibitors to cool off?</h2>

<p>All exhibitor tables will be under tents, but the Steel Yard is in an industrial area and can get hot! There will be an air-conditioned cooling area indoors with water available. There is a metal ADA-compliant ramp leading into the cooling station. There will be another air conditioned indoor cooling station at Binch Press/Queer.Archive.Work, down the block and across the street. Masks are required in indoor areas, including both cooling stations.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-bathrooms-are-on-on-site">What kind of bathrooms are on on-site?</h2>

<p>There is an accessible outdoor port-a-potty available. If you need an indoor restroom for accessibility reasons, please ask a Fest organizer.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-covid-policies">What are your COVID policies?</h2>

<p>We are holding this event outside and will have a designated organizer to hand out masks. We ask that you consider wearing masks even though this is an outside event. If you are interacting with an exhibitor or organizer wearing a mask, it would be kind to reciprocate by putting on a mask as well. We will have both surgical masks and K95 masks (upon request) for exhibitors, volunteers, and attendees. If you have cold or flu-like symptoms, we ask that you not attend the event. We will have a limited supply of rapid tests available for exhibitors and volunteers at our reading and the zinefest itself.</p>

<h2 id="will-there-be-food-or-beverages">Will there be food or beverages?</h2>

<p>We are not selling food, but there are a variety of options nearby, including Subway, Dunkin Donuts, and Vasilios Pizza right around the corner. If you’re looking for a cafe, New Harvest Coffee is just across the street.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-report-an-issue-to-an-organizer">Can I report an issue to an organizer?</h2>

<p>Yes, we will have organizers and volunteers at the welcome table to address any issues around accessibility or oppressive behavior. Refer to our Statement of Collective Responsibility.</p>

<h2 id="will-there-be-a-medic-on-site">Will there be a medic on-site?</h2>

<p>Yes, we will have a medic tent stationed with water and light snacks.</p>

<h2 id="will-there-be-shade-structures-or-sun-protection">Will there be shade structures or sun protection?</h2>

<p>Yes, in addition to tents for exhibitors, there will be tents and sun sails throughout the space.</p>

<h2 id="are-dogs-allowed-at-this-event">Are dogs allowed at this event?</h2>

<p>Service animals and well-behaved, leashed dogs are welcome on site, but please be aware of everyone’s comfort level.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-get-to-this-event">How can I get to this event?</h2>

<p>Get off at the RIPTA bus stop on Atwells Avenue before Harris Avenue. Take Harris Ave one block and then turn left onto Sims Avenue. The Steel Yard’s main barrier free entrance is located on Sims Ave.</p>

<p>There is also street parking on Sims Ave, if arriving by car.</p>
