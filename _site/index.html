Drawing from the language of their everyday, Vic's work flows between images, objects, and diasporic memory to sit with moments of quiet possibility. <br><br>Together, they are translating their work into the more tangible and accessible form of print objects, which they are excited to let into queer/trans communities’ lives in ways that allow for repeated revisitation. They are curating a “reading room” atmosphere for their QTZ table which will center slow meditation and non-monetary exchange around their prints and zines, although all material will still be available for sale.</p>

      <p class="section-body">
        We’ve been organizing this fest since 2017, which started as a program of AS220’s Queer Arts Fest, and before that, several members of our team organized the Rhode Island Publishing Expo. We’ve hosted hundreds of queer and trans exhibitors and thousands of attendees, and we’re proud to have been a fest that has always been completely free for our tablers. While planning this year’s fest, we realized that many of us are ready to move on to other projects, including making our own zines (like a zine on fest organizing).

        Though this is our last QTZ, we’re excited to make it the best iteration yet. Thank you so much for your support and enthusiasm over the years, and we hope you’ll consider attending or applying for QTZ 2024!

			<h2 id="what-is-qtz" class="section-body">What is QTZ?</h2>

			<p class="section-body">The Queer/Trans Zine Fest (QTZ) is a free 1-day zine fair held on unceded Narragansett land (Providence, RI) organized by and for queer, trans, and gender non-conforming people. Our definition of “zine” is deliberately broad and we invite all creative people with radical ideas to apply. In the past, our exhibitors have included poets, comic artists, community organizations, and activist collectives, as well as makers of ceramics, apparel, herbal medicines, and textiles.</p>

			<h2 id="when-and-where-is-qtz-2024-taking-place" class="section-body">When and where is QTZ 2024 taking place?</h2>

			<p class="section-body">QTZ 2024 will take place outdoors at The Steel Yard on Saturday, August 31, 2024 from 11am–5pm. There will be additional programming throughout that weekend at the Binch Press / Queer.Archive.Work Studio.</p>

			<h2 id="is-qtz-free" class="section-body">Is QTZ free?</h2>

			<p class="section-body">Yes! QTZ is free to attendees and exhibitors. There is no tabling fee and exhibitors will be offered a small stipend on a sliding scale.</p>

			<h2 id="how-does-the-qtz-application-process-work" class="section-body">How does the QTZ application process work?</h2>

			<p class="section-body">Once applications close on Monday May 27th, 2024 at 11:59pm, they will be reviewed by the QTZ fest organizers using a rubric that prioritizes Providence-based Black, Indigenous, people of color.</p>

			<h2 id="is-this-event-wheelchair-accessible" class="section-body">Is this event wheelchair-accessible?</h2>

			<p class="section-body">Yes! The Steel Yard hosts a variety of events throughout the year, including Queer/Trans Zinefest. All Steel Yard events are 100% wheelchair accessible. Event attendees have access to both a fully ADA accessible portable restroom as well as custom wheelchair-accessible picnic tables.</p>

			<p class="section-body">The Steel Yard’s outdoor area is paved, with a combination of bricks and permeable concrete. It is mostly flat and even, with a slight slope in some areas. The main entry to the Fest location is connected to the sidewalk with a slight upward slope.</p>

			<h2 id="do-you-have-a-way-for-attendeesexhibitors-to-cool-off" class="section-body">Do you have a way for attendees/exhibitors to cool off?</h2>

			<p class="section-body">All exhibitor tables will be under tents, but the Steel Yard is in an industrial area and can get hot! There will be an air-conditioned cooling area indoors with water available. There is a metal ADA-compliant ramp leading into the cooling station. There will be another air conditioned indoor cooling station at Binch Press/Queer.Archive.Work, down the block and across the street.

      <h2 class="section-body">Collective Responsibility Statement</h2>

      <p class="section-body">As participants and attendees of Providence Queer/Trans Zinefest, we ask that you hold yourselves and each other responsible for your conduct and look out for each other at this fest. As an open-access and public event, we cannot guarantee a space free of sexism, racism, homophobia. However, we ask that you to keep in mind the principle of mutual and collective responsibility.</p>

      <p class="section-body">As zinefest organizers, we will be available in advance and on the day of the event to address any issues that come up. We commit to dealing with these issues in a calm and open-minded way, and we ask you to do the same.</p>

      <p class="section-body">The zinefest is an opportunity for meeting each other and learning, not for pursuing ongoing conflicts. If an individual is known to have engaged in oppressive behavior, then it is up to people who know them to put accountability processes in place. If that has not been done, the zinefest is not the time or place to do so. Organizers and participants cannot and will not act as judge, jury, or police force. However, we will do our best to deal with situations that arise at the zinefest. We reserve the right to ask anybody acting in what we consider to be an inappropriate manner to leave the event.</p>

      <p class="section-body">If you need assistance during the zinefest, please come to the welcome table at the entrance to the vendor area.</p>

      <p class="section-body">In compliance with the our agreement with the venue, and for participants’ health and safety, the following must be observed:</p>
      <ul class="section-body">
        <li>Smoking anything is permitted only in designated smoking areas</li>
        <li>No alcohol may be consumed on the premises</li>
      </ul>
