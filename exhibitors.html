    <p class="exhibitor-bio">ùñÜùñìùñôùñé-ùñáùñîùñìùñä press is a publication project to inspired by the Korean translation of Î∞òÍ≥®(ÂèçÈ™®) which means "bones are protruding in reverse," which signifies a mindset of resisting and not following the world's affairs or orders from above. It is a queer/trans centered publication project based in Richmond, Virginia that aims to push further that definition of contrarian spirit, the physiognomy of a ‚Äútraitor.‚Äù<br><br>What does it mean to embody a rebellious bone? According to ancient East Asian physiognomy, the biological form of the "anti-bone" was believed to mean something like the back of the head protruding or the bones of the cervical region, the nape of the neck, being prominent. In the past, it was a negative word attached to traitors. To have an anti-bone in your family, their very existence was dishonorable. In later generations, it was also used in a neutral sense for resisting or disobeying authority. Especially when that authority is not legitimate, the term 'rebel' can even be used as a compliment close to 'a fighter against unfair power'.</p>

    <p class="exhibitor-bio">Ripley Ash is a chronically-ill, nonbinary illustrator who lives in Brooklyn, and previously lived in Texas for 27 years. Their work explores dread and unease through environments, many scenes pulled directly from locations right outside their door. They currently have a series called ‚ÄòMetastasize‚Äô that explores these feelings with capitalism and the climate crisis manifesting into a cosmic horror story about Brooklyn. Another theme they are working on, ‚ÄòNo More Body‚Äô, explores the horror of the body and gender identity. With these themes expressed in horror imagery juxtaposed with mostly pastels and light colors, some have described their work as "cute existentialism".  They also love anime, horror movies, and drawing their favorite queer characters. </p>
