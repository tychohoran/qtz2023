# QTZ FAQ and Accessibility

## What is QTZ?

## When and where is QTZ 2023 taking place?

QTZ 2023 will take place outdoors at The Steel Yard on Saturday, September 2, 2023 from 11am–5pm. There will be additional programming throughout that weekend at the Binch Press / Queer.Archive.Work Studio.

## Is this event wheelchair-accessible?

Yes! The Steel Yard hosts a variety of events throughout the year, including Queer/Trans Zinefest. All Steel Yard events are 100% wheelchair accessible. Event attendees have access to both a fully ADA accessible portable restroom as well as custom wheelchair-accessible picnic tables.

## What are your COVID policies?

We are holding this event outside and will have a designated organizer to hand out masks. We ask that you consider wearing masks even though this is an outside event. If you are interacting with an exhibitor or organizer wearing a mask, it would be kind to reciprocate by putting on a mask as well. We will have both surgical masks and K95 masks (upon request) for exhibitors, volunteers, and attendees. If you have cold or flu-like symptoms, we ask that you not attend the event. We will have a limited supply of rapid tests available for exhibitors and volunteers.

## Will there be food or beverages?

We are not selling food, but there are a variety of options nearby, including Subway, Dunkin Donuts, and Vasilios Pizza right around the corner. If you’re looking for a cafe, New Harvest Coffee is just across the street.

## Can I report an issue to an organizer?

Yes, we will have organizers and volunteers at the welcome table to address any issues around accessibility or oppressive behavior. Refer to our Statement of Collective Responsibility.

## Will there be a medic on-site?

Yes, we will have a medic tent stationed with water and light snacks.

## Will there be shade structures or sun protection?

## Are dogs allowed at this event?

Service animals and well-behaved, leashed dogs are welcome on site, but please be aware of everyone’s comfort level.

## Will programs or speakers have amplified sound?
